# Pakistan-Violent-Threatening-Healthcare
In this project, I looked at two datasets that included information on violent and threatening incidents that impaced aid operations, civilians, education, healthcare, refugees and IDPs in Pakistan. All of this is to make sure that the staff is safe and that hopefully there will be better response outcomes in the future. The datasets had a lot of missing values and I replaced them with 0.
